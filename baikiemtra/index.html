            <p class="career-text">Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean start-ups and was a member of the first New Zealand start-up to attend Y Combinator, the largest start-up accelerator in the world. From there, I worked my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw the design of 30+ mobile and desktop apps. Currently, I am a Senior Product Designer at Linktree leading design for the Linktree mobile app.</p>
